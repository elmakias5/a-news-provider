# a-news-provider

A simple RSS feed android application.
This project is intended for demo app for a-navigator and a-provider library usage.
The app still works as production even though it is demo app.

## Project Structure

The app uses a-navigator framework as navigator and StatefulView as base structure,
combined with a-provider library for service locator,
and finally RxAndroid to handle UI use cases.
